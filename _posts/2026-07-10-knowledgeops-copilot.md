## Case study: building a local knowledge assistant

KnowledgeOps Copilot is the first project in my applied AI portfolio. It shows how a simple local desktop app can turn scattered documents into a searchable, source-aware workflow.

## Project summary

KnowledgeOps Copilot is a local Python desktop app that helps a user search a folder of documents and receive source-backed answers. The goal is not to replace human judgment. The goal is to make scattered knowledge easier to find, review, and explain.

## The business problem

A lot of organizations have important information spread across SOPs, onboarding files, PDFs, shared folders, old notes, and informal documentation. The problem is not only that information exists. The problem is that people waste time finding it, checking whether it is current, and deciding whether they can trust it.

For this first case study, I wanted to build a small local tool around one question:

> Can a lightweight AI-style workflow make internal knowledge easier to search while keeping answers traceable to source documents?

## Why I built it locally

I prefer local apps when possible because they are easier to control, easier to demo, and do not depend on a third-party website staying online. For a portfolio project, a local executable also shows that the project is more than a prompt experiment. It has setup scripts, an interface, packaging, sample data, and a repeatable workflow.

## Workflow before

A typical manual process looks like this:

1. Open a shared folder.
2. Guess which document contains the answer.
3. Search several files manually.
4. Copy the useful detail into a message or note.
5. Hope the document is current.
6. Repeat the same search later.

## Workflow after

The app changes the flow:

1. Select a document folder.
2. Ask a question.
3. Review the answer.
4. Check the source files and confidence score.
5. Open the source if needed.
6. Decide whether the answer is good enough to use.

## Technical architecture

The first version is intentionally simple:

- Python app entry point
- Tkinter desktop GUI
- Local document loader
- Search and scoring module
- Freshness-checking helper
- Output logging
- PowerShell scripts for setup, run, test, and EXE build

The app currently supports common local document formats such as text, Markdown, CSV, JSON, Python files, PDFs, and Word documents depending on installed modules.

## Guardrails

The main guardrail is source awareness. The app should not behave like a generic chatbot that answers without showing where the information came from. It should show the documents used and make uncertainty visible.

The project also keeps the first version local. That reduces setup complexity and avoids sending private documents to an online service.

## What I learned

The biggest lesson from this build is that useful AI tools are not only about model power. The surrounding workflow matters just as much: file handling, interface design, source display, confidence, testing, packaging, and documentation.

A simple tool becomes more professional when it can be installed, run, tested, explained, and improved in public.

## Limitations

This first version is not a full enterprise search system. It does not include user permissions, shared indexing, cloud syncing, advanced semantic embeddings, or full audit review. It is a working prototype meant to show the workflow and implementation direction.

## Next iteration

The next improvements I would consider are:

- Better ranking for long documents
- Direct “open source file” buttons
- More detailed freshness warnings
- A duplicate-document review screen
- Exportable Q&A logs
- Optional local embedding search
- A stronger evaluation set with expected answers

## Portfolio value

This project is designed to show more than code. It shows the ability to define a business problem, build a working local tool, document the workflow, explain guardrails, and present the result in a way a non-technical stakeholder could understand.
